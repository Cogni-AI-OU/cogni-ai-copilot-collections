# critical-thinking

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 MD023 MD031 MD032 -->

A cognitive framework for deep analytical reasoning.

## When to Use

- When confronted with an ambiguous, contradictory, or complex problem that defies immediate technical fixes.
- Before embarking on a massive, repository-wide architectural refactoring.
- When an automated test or build fails silently and standard debugging yields no obvious root cause.

## When Not to Use

- For trivial syntax errors or obvious spelling mistakes.
- When the user explicitly requests immediate, uncritical execution of a basic command without review.
- If a problem is already solved and simply requires writing documentation.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Paralysis by Analysis**: Spending so much time red-teaming and generating alternative hypotheses that no actual code gets written or debugged.
- **Ignoring Empirical Data**: Relying purely on abstract logical models while ignoring the actual tracebacks or logs presented in the current environment.
- **Over-Modeling**: Writing a 500-line MiniZinc model for a problem that can be solved with a simple unit test.

## Core Process

1. **Deconstruct & Frame**: Separate the final goal (Conclusion) from the underlying logic (Premises).
2. **Surface Hidden Dependencies**: Identify what must be true for the current logic to hold (assumptions, state, concurrency).
3. **Generate Hypotheses**: Explicitly list alternative explanations or missing context before acting.
4. **Root Cause Isolation**: When troubleshooting, split the problem into smaller, reproducible steps and use version history (`git blame`/`git log`) or execution logs to narrow down the fault.
5. **Adversarial Red-Teaming**: Aggressively attempt to break your proposed plan. Identify the exact line or condition most likely to fail.
6. **Constraint Formulation (MiniZinc)**: When applicable, formally model the problem's constraints by writing dry-code definitions in MiniZinc to expose hidden dependencies and restrictions.
7. **Verify Systemically**: Evaluate the decision against immediate needs, technical debt accrual, and long-term maintainability.

## Core Principles

- **Active Disconfirmation**: Do not seek evidence that confirms your theory; design experiments that would prove your favorite hypothesis wrong.
- **Burden of Proof Calibration**: Align evidence requirements with risk. High-risk changes demand formal-level proof; low-risk changes require empirical checks.
- **Constraint-Aware Design**: Explicitly map and adhere to project-specific constraints (architectural, performance, security).
- **Fact-Based Reasoning**: Base every decision on empirically gathered facts from the codebase rather than assumptions.
- **Formal Constraint Mapping**: Use MiniZinc snippets as a dry-code exercise to rigorously define problem boundaries, resources, and requirements.
- **Information Gain Optimization**: Prioritize actions that maximize information about the system's state over actions that merely "try to fix it."
- **Internal Tension Scan**: Search for self-contradictions within the plan (e.g., claiming a system is "high-performance" while introducing O(n²) complexity in a critical path).
- **Socratic Depth**: Apply a minimum "3-Why" drill-down for any anomaly. Move from the immediate symptom to the behavioral anomaly, to the foundational flaw.
- **The Steelman Protocol**: Before critiquing a plan, articulate it in its strongest possible form. If you cannot Steelman it, you are not ready to reject it.

## Diagnostics and Usage Patterns

- **MiniZinc Dry-Code**:
  Write MiniZinc `.mzn` snippets to formally declare the parameters, decision variables, and constraints of the problem space, even if you do not execute the solver immediately.

## What to Avoid

- **Confirmation Bias**: Over-weighting evidence that supports an initial guess while ignoring contradictory anomalies.
- **Shallow Fixes**: Patching symptoms instead of addressing the architectural or structural root causes.
- **The Sunk Cost Fallacy**: Persisting with a failing approach or refactor just because effort was already invested.

## Limitations

- This skill provides a cognitive framework but does not execute external tooling; it relies on the agent to apply these principles internally during planning, execution, and review phases.
