# Git Rebase

Expert-level guidance for executing Git rebase operations safely, particularly distinguishing between interactive manual usage and automated environments.

## Interactive Rebasing (`git rebase -i`)

- **Objective**: Clean up local commit history before pushing.
- **Process**:
  - **WARNING**: Interactive modes (`-i`) are FORBIDDEN in runtime automation. Ensure `-i` is strictly scoped to local manual-only usage or fixing in the non-GitHub runtime (like in local agent or devcontainer runtime).
  - Start manual rebase: `git rebase -i <base-commit-or-branch>`
  - Non-interactive note: `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=true` only skips opening the editor; it does **not** rewrite the rebase todo list.
  - Scripted rewrites: For automation, set `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR` to a script or command that edits the todo file, or prefer `git rebase -i --autosquash` with `fixup!` / `squash!` commits when appropriate.
  - Actions in the todo list: `pick`, `reword`, `edit`, `squash` (or `s`), `fixup` (or `f`), `drop`.

## Safety Principles

- NEVER rebase commits that have already been pushed to a shared public branch unless explicitly coordinating a force-push.
- **Abort**: Execute `git rebase --abort` to safely cancel an ongoing rebase operation.

## What to Avoid

- Interactive command execution (`git rebase -i`) in automated runtime pipelines.

## Limitations

- Cannot autonomously perform interactive rebasing in restricted runtime environments.
