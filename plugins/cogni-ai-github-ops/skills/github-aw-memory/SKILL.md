Persistent memory strategy for GitHub Agentic Workflows (`cache-memory`, `repo-memory`, `comment-memory`).

## When to Use

- To persist workflow state across multiple runs (e.g., maintaining a daily progress tracker).
- When a workflow needs to remember which PRs or issues it has already processed to avoid duplicate work.
- To store configuration baselines or operational notes (using `repo-memory`) that must survive cache expiration.

## When Not to Use

- When the state can be trivially derived from existing GitHub abstractions (e.g., checking if a label exists instead of writing a memory file).
- For storing highly sensitive secrets or credentials (use GitHub Secrets instead).
- If the workflow runs completely statelessly and completes all processing in a single run.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Colons in Filenames**: Using timestamps with colons (like `2026-05-01-12:00:00`) as cache keys, which instantly breaks the artifact upload on Windows runners.
- **Cache Eviction**: Relying on `cache-memory` for long-term storage, forgetting that GitHub automatically deletes caches after 7 days of inactivity.
- **Noisy Commits**: Using `repo-memory` for ephemeral per-run state, polluting the Git history with hundreds of tiny, meaningless commits.

## Core Principles

- **Prefer Built-in History**: Rely on Git history, issue timelines, and graph links before writing new persistent files. Store only stable watermarks (SHA, updated_at).
- **Default to `cache-memory`**: Use for deduplication, incremental processing, and metric baselines. It avoids repository noise but expires (default 7 days).
- **Use `repo-memory` Sparingly**: Use only for long-lived knowledge (e.g., security baselines) that must survive cache expiry. Produces Git commits.
- **Use `comment-memory`**: Persist workflow notes inline on the triggering issue/PR.

## Commands / Usage Patterns

**`cache-memory` (First Choice)**
```yaml
tools:
  cache-memory: true # Or specific config
```
- Path: `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/`
- Safe timestamps: MUST use `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS` (no colons, `T`, or `Z`) to prevent artifact upload failures.

**`repo-memory` (Persistent/Auditable)**
```yaml
tools:
  repo-memory:
    branch-name: memory/agent-notes
    allowed-extensions: [".json", ".md"]
```
- Path: `/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory/`
- Engine restriction: Requires Claude or custom engine. Copilot NOT supported.
- Variants: Use `wiki: true` for GitHub Wiki backend.

**`comment-memory` (Issue/PR Scope)**
```yaml
tools:
  comment-memory: true
```
- Path: `/tmp/gh-aw/comment-memory/<memory_id>.md`

## What to Avoid

- Using `repo-memory` for ephemeral per-run state or as a synonym for `cache-memory`.
- Including colons in `cache-memory` filenames (breaks Windows-hosted runners artifact upload).
- Caching full issue payloads instead of canonical identifiers.
