# AGENTS.md

Persistent single-source truth for autonomous agent behavior.

For general project invariants see [README.md](../README.md).

## Directory-Specific Agent files

Read and merge these when operating inside corresponding sub-directories (order = precedence):

- [`.github/AGENTS.md`](../.github/AGENTS.md)
- Any `AGENTS.md` or `SKILL.md` in ancestor, then current directory tree

## Required References

- Agent configuration & conventions: [../.github/copilot-instructions.md](../.github/copilot-instructions.md)
- Latest org baseline: <https://github.com/Cogni-AI-OU/.github/blob/main/AGENTS.md>
- Project overview & install: [../README.md](../README.md)
- Workflow navigation: [../.tours/getting-started.tour](../.tours/getting-started.tour)

## Project Structure and Workflows

### Directory Layout

- `skills/`: Skill directories (each contains a `SKILL.md`)
- `../.github/workflows/`: GitHub Actions for CI/CD and automation
- `../.tours/`: Guided walkthroughs for repository onboarding

### Key Workflows

- `../.github/workflows/check.yml`: Runs pre-commit checks and validation
- `../.github/workflows/cogni-ai-agent.yml`: Primary agent interaction workflow
- `../.github/workflows/devcontainer-ci.yml`: Validates development container configuration

## Skills

You MUST load the skills relevant to the user prompt, inferred intent,
and planned work into the current context. See [../AGENTS-RUNTIME.md](../AGENTS-RUNTIME.md)
for the full skills catalog, loading instructions, and structural invariants.

### Brainstorming vs. Critical Thinking

- **`brainstorm`**: Use this skill for **divergent exploration**.
  It focuses on open-ended research, generating multiple orthogonal architectural paths
  (Design-It-Twice), recursive decomposition, and visualizing options via high-level
  Mermaid diagrams.
- **`critical-thinking`**: Use this skill for **convergent evaluation**.
  It focuses on deep analytical reasoning, adversarial red-teaming, surfacing
  hidden dependencies, root cause isolation, and formal constraint mapping
  (e.g., MiniZinc dry-code).

### Final Assurance Gates

- Keep this file entropy-pruned and up-to-date.
- Inject full content into every sub-agent context.
- For latest standard see: <https://agents.md/>

## Common Tasks

### Before each commit

- Verify your expected changes with `git diff --no-color`.
- Ensure no temporary, dummy, or unrelated test files are included in the commit.
- Use the project linting/validation tools to confirm your changes meet the coding standard.
- If the repo uses git hooks, run them to validate your changes.

### File operations

### Editing files

- When modifying or creating documentation and plain text files, always enforce line-wrapping and length
  limits in accordance with project-defined standards (such as `.markdownlint.yaml` or `.editorconfig`).

### Renaming/removing files

- Use `git mv`, `git rm`, or equivalent Git-aware tooling (instead of `mv` or `rm`) to preserve history
  when working with files under source control.

## Feature-specific Notes

### opencode

OpenCode (if installed) uses XDG base directories (not a single `~/.opencode` dir):

| Directory                 | Purpose                                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `~/.local/share/opencode` | Data **and** auth credentials (`auth.json` lives here) |
| `~/.config/opencode`      | User configuration (`opencode.json`/`opencode.jsonc`)  |
| `~/.cache/opencode`       | Ephemeral binary cache - not worth persisting          |
| `~/.local/state/opencode` | Runtime state - not worth persisting                   |

- **`ollama-cli`**
  Ollama is used for local LLM execution.
  - **Daemon Dependency**: Ensure the Ollama daemon is running (e.g., `ollama serve &`).
  - **Shell Requirement**: Commands using process substitution (e.g., `<(echo ...)`) MUST run in `bash` or `zsh`, NOT
    standard `/bin/sh`.

## Tooling

- Use MCP when possible.
- Use `pre-commit` for linting and validation if installed.
- For dumping links use `links -dump` if installed.

### Understanding the Task

- When the task is not clear, look for additional context.
- If triggered by a brief comment, check whether the parent comment exists and includes more detail.
- If it's still ambiguous, communicate with the user and propose options.

### Adding or Modifying Workflows

- Workflows in `../.github/workflows/` can be reused via `workflow_call`
- Test workflow changes on a feature branch before merging to main
- Use `actionlint` to validate workflow syntax locally

### Updating Coding Standards

- Language-specific conventions reside in individual skill directories alongside their `SKILL.md`
- Update `../.markdownlint.yaml`, `../.yamllint`, or `../.editorconfig` for linting rules
- Run `pre-commit run -a` to verify changes pass all checks

### Skill references

- Cross-skill references in `SKILL.md` files must not use relative paths
  (e.g., `../path/SKILL.md`).
- When skills are loaded, they are available to the agent via tools, and the agent does not follow
  relative filesystem paths between them.
- Reference skills by their name (e.g., `gh-api`, `git`) instead of file links,
  as they are dynamically loaded by the agent via tools.
- **Avoid cyclic references**: To prevent infinite agent loops, cross-references in `SKILL.md` files
  must be acyclic.
- **No back-references**: Specialized sub-skills (e.g., `gh-pr`, `git-expert`) must not reference
  their parent command skill (`gh`, `git`).
- **Uni-directional sibling references**: Sibling skills should only reference each other in a single
  direction (e.g., `molecule` can reference `ansible`, but `ansible` should not reference `molecule`).

### Plugin-skill migration

- When a skill is moved from `skills/` to a plugin directory under `plugins/`, it MUST be removed
  from the table in `skills/README.md`. The `skills/README.md` catalog lists only skills resident
  in the `skills/` directory; plugin-bundled skills are documented by their plugin's own `README.md`.

## Troubleshooting

### Firewall issues

If you encounter firewall issues when using the GitHub Copilot Agent:

- Refer to <https://gh.io/copilot/firewall-config> for configuration details.
- Do not work around blocked URLs by adding markdown-link-check ignore/whitelist patterns for real links.
- Keep markdown-link-check validating real links, and request firewall allowlisting instead.
- If you need to allowlist additional hosts, update your firewall configuration accordingly
  by following [../.github/FIREWALL.md](../.github/FIREWALL.md) and keep that file up to date.

### GitHub Runtime issues

- If you encounter issues while running in GitHub Actions, refer to the loading instructions in [../AGENTS-RUNTIME.md](../AGENTS-RUNTIME.md).
