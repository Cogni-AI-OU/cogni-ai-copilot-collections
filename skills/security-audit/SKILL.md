# Security Auditing Skill

This skill outlines the mechanical steps, mindset, and procedures required to conduct a thorough security
audit on a target codebase or architectural component. It integrates dependency analysis,
deep vulnerability scanning, structured threat modeling, and strict output constraints.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the request involves:

- Scanning a codebase or file for security vulnerabilities
- Running a security audit or vulnerability check
- Checking for SQL injection, XSS, command injection, or other injection flaws
- Finding exposed API keys, hardcoded secrets, or credentials in code
- Auditing dependencies for known CVEs
- Reviewing authentication, authorization, or access control logic
- Detecting insecure cryptography or weak randomness
- Performing a data flow analysis to trace user input to dangerous sinks
- Any request phrasing like "is my code secure?", "scan this file", or "check my repo for vulnerabilities"
- Running `/security-audit` or `/security-audit <path>`

## When Not to Use

- When performing a lightweight PR review (use `security-review`).
- When writing tests for functional validation (use `testing` or `tdd`).
- When optimizing code purely for performance without a security context.

## Common Pitfalls

- **False Positives**: Flagging code as vulnerable purely based on regex matches without considering existing
  sanitization or trust boundaries.
- **Ignoring the Supply Chain**: Auditing the source code meticulously but neglecting to check `package.json` or
  `requirements.txt` for known CVEs.
- **Suggesting Breaking Changes**: Recommending heavy-handed security controls that completely break the
  application's core business logic.

## Role Persona & Cognitive Framework

- **Adversarial Attacker Engine**: Think like an advanced persistent threat (APT). Ask "How can I bypass this check?",
  "What happens if this input is 10GB?", and "Can I pivot from this resource to another?"
- **Zero-Trust Assumption Principle**: Assume developers have made the most common mistake and that the network is
  already compromised.
- **Root Cause Vulnerability Tracing**: Trace security flaws to their architectural root.
- **Audit-Only Enforcement**: Base your analysis on reading the code, static analysis, and configuration inspection.
- **Exploit & Remediation Pairing**: For every vulnerability found, provide both the adversarial attack scenario and
  an exact, implementable remediation.

## 1. Threat Surface Discovery & Triage

1. **Architecture & Trust Boundary Mapping**:
   - Identify all primary assets, actors, data flows, and entry points.
   - Map explicit trust boundaries.
2. **Dependency & Supply Chain Audit**:
   - Analyze dependency manifests to identify vulnerable dependencies (known CVEs).

## 2. Deep Vulnerability Audit Execution

Execute a rigorous, ordered security analysis against the target architecture:

1. **Injection & Input Handling**: SQLi, XSS, command injection.
2. **Authentication & Authorization**: RBAC, IDOR, session management.
3. **Secrets, Cryptography & Data Protection**: Credential scanning, weak crypto.
4. **Security Headers & Network Config**: CSP, HSTS, CORS.
5. **Third-Party Integrations**: Webhooks, API keys.
6. **AI & Prompt Security**: Prompt injection boundaries.

## 3. Threat Modeling & Exploitability Assessment

1. **STRIDE Analysis**.
2. **Attack Scenario Formulation**.
3. **Blast-Radius Check**.
4. **Risk Ranking**.

## 4. Remediation Reporting

Output the full report in the structured format defined in `references/report-format.md`.

### Output Format

The report MUST include:

1. **Findings Summary Table**.
2. **Detailed Findings**.
3. **Dependency Audit**.
4. **Secrets Scan**.
5. **Patch Proposals**.

## Execution Workflow

### Step 1 — Scope Resolution

### Step 2 — Dependency Audit

### Step 3 — Secrets & Exposure Scan

### Step 4 — Vulnerability Deep Scan

### Step 5 — Cross-File Data Flow Analysis

### Step 6 — Self-Verification Pass

### Step 7 — Generate Security Report

### Step 8 — Propose Patches

## Severity Guide

| Severity | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🔴 CRITICAL | Immediate exploitation risk, data breach likely |
| 🟠 HIGH | Serious vulnerability, exploit path exists |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | Exploitable with conditions or chaining |
| 🔵 LOW | Best practice violation, low direct risk |
| ⚪ INFO | Observation worth noting |
